//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! Payment Initiation (PI) is a library that provides a set of structs
//! and enums that can be used to serialize and deserialize SEPA payment
//! information using the `serde` library.
//!
//! The structs include Payment, OriginalGroupInfoAndStatus, PaymentInfo,
//! PaymentTypeInfo, ServiceLevel, Debtor, PostalAddress, DebtorAccount,
//! AccountId, DebtorAgent, FinancialInstitutionId,
//! CreditTransferTransactionInfo, PaymentId, Amount, InstructedAmount,
//! Creditor, CreditorAccount, RemittanceInfo, and CreditorAgent.
//!
//! The enum is PaymentFormat and has four variants: Pain001_001_02,
//! Pain001_001_03, Pain001_001_04, and Pain001_001_05.
//!
//!
//! ## PaymentFormat
//!
//! The `PaymentFormat` enum defines the different formats of payment supported by the system.
//!
//! ## Payment
//!
//! The `Payment` struct is the main data structure used to represent a payment. It contains the following fields:
//!
//! - `payment_format`: The format of the payment, represented by the `PaymentFormat` enum.
//! - `original_group_info_and_status`: Information about the original group and its status, represented by the `OriginalGroupInfoAndStatus` struct.
//! - `payment_info`: Information about the payment, represented by the `PaymentInfo` struct.
//!
//! ## OriginalGroupInfoAndStatus
//!
//! The `OriginalGroupInfoAndStatus` struct contains information about the original group and its status. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `original_message_id`: The original message ID.
//! - `original_message_name_id`: The original message name ID.
//! - `group_status`: The status of the group.
//!
//! ## PaymentInfo
//!
//! The `PaymentInfo` struct contains information about the payment. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `payment_info_id`: The ID of the payment information.
//! - `payment_method`: The method used for the payment.
//! - `number_of_transactions`: The number of transactions in the payment.
//! - `control_sum`: The control sum of the payment.
//! - `payment_type_info`: Information about the type of payment, represented by the `PaymentTypeInfo` struct.
//! - `requested_execution_date`: The requested execution date of the payment.
//! - `debtor`: Information about the debtor, represented by the `Debtor` struct.
//! - `debtor_account`: Information about the debtor's account, represented by the `DebtorAccount` struct.
//! - `debtor_agent`: Information about the debtor's agent, represented by the `DebtorAgent` struct.
//! - `credit_transfer_transaction_info`: Information about the credit transfer transactions, represented by the `CreditTransferTransactionInfo` struct.
//!
//! ## PaymentTypeInfo
//!
//! The `PaymentTypeInfo` struct contains information about the type of payment. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `service_level`: The service level of the payment, represented by the `ServiceLevel` struct.
//! - `local_instrument`: The local instrument used for the payment.
//! - `payment_type_id`: The ID of the payment type.
//!
//! ## ServiceLevel
//!
//! The `ServiceLevel` struct contains information about the service level of a payment. It has the following field:
//!
//! - `code`: The code representing the service level.
//!
//! ## Debtor
//! The `Debtor` struct contains information about the debtor. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `name`: The name of the debtor.
//! - `postal_address`: The postal address of the debtor, represented by the `PostalAddress` struct.
//!
//! ## PostalAddress
//!
//! The `PostalAddress` struct contains information about a postal address. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `country`: The country of the address.
//! - `address_line`: The lines of the address.
//! //!
//! # DebtorAccount
//!
//! The `DebtorAccount` struct contains information about the debtor's account. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `id`: The ID of the account, represented by the `AccountId` struct.
//!
//! # AccountId
//!
//! The `AccountId` struct contains information about an account ID. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `IBAN`: The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) of the account.
//! - `other`: Information about other types of accounts, represented by the `OtherAccountId` struct.
//!
//! # OtherAccountId
//!
//! The `OtherAccountId` struct contains information about other types of accounts. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `id`: The ID of the account.
//! - `issuer`: The issuer of the account.
//!
//! # DebtorAgent
//!
//! The `DebtorAgent` struct contains information about the debtor's agent. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `financial_institution_id`: The ID of the financial institution.
//!
//! # CreditTransferTransactionInfo
//!
//! The `CreditTransferTransactionInfo` struct contains information about the credit transfer transactions. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `amount`: The amount of the transaction.
//! - `currency`: The currency of the transaction.
//! - `remittance_information`: The remittance information of the transaction.
//! - `creditor`: Information about the creditor, represented by the `Creditor` struct.
//! - `creditor_account`: Information about the creditor's account, represented by the `CreditorAccount` struct.
//! - `creditor_agent`: Information about the creditor's agent, represented by the `CreditorAgent` struct.
//! - `ultimate_creditor`: Information about the ultimate creditor, represented by the `UltimateCreditor` struct.
//!
//! # Creditor
//!
//! The `Creditor` struct contains information about the creditor. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `name`: The name of the creditor.
//! - `postal_address`: The postal address of the creditor, represented by the `PostalAddress` struct.
//!
//! # CreditorAccount
//!
//! The `CreditorAccount` struct contains information about the creditor's account. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `id`: The ID of the account, represented by the `AccountId` struct.
//!
//! # CreditorAgent
//!
//! The `CreditorAgent` struct contains information about the creditor's agent. It has the following fields:
//!
//! - `financial_institution_id`: The ID of the financial institution.
//!
//! # UltimateCreditor
//!
//! The `UltimateCreditor` struct contains information about the ultimate creditor. It has the following fields:
//!

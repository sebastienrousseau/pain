## Overview üìñ

Payment Initiation (PI) is a library that provides a set of structs
and enums that can be used to serialize and deserialize SEPA payment
information using the `serde` library.

The structs include Payment, OriginalGroupInfoAndStatus, PaymentInfo,
PaymentTypeInfo, ServiceLevel, Debtor, PostalAddress, DebtorAccount,
AccountId, DebtorAgent, FinancialInstitutionId,
CreditTransferTransactionInfo, PaymentId, Amount, InstructedAmount,
Creditor, CreditorAccount, RemittanceInfo, and CreditorAgent.

The enum is PaymentFormat and has four variants: Pain001_001_02,
Pain001_001_03, Pain001_001_04, and Pain001_001_05.
